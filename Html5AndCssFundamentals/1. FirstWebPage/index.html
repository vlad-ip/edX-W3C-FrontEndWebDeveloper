            <h2><q>IF—</q> by Rudyard Kipling</h2>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    &quot;If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
                    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
                    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
                    But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
                    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
                    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
                    Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
                    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
                    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
                    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
                    And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
                    If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
                    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
                    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
                    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
                    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
                    And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
                    And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
                    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
                    To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
                    And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
                    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
                    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
                    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
                    If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
                    If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
                    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>
                    Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
                    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!&quot;<br>
                </p>
