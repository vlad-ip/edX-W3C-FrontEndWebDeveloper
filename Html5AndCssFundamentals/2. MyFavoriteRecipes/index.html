            <blockquote>
                I remember coming home sullen one day because we'd lost a softball game. Grandma, in her wisdom,
                suggested,<br><br>
                &quot;Maybe a slice of my homemade apple pie will make you feel better.&quot;<br><br>
                One bite, and Grandma was right.<br>
                If you want to learn how to make homemade apple pie filling, this is
                really
                the only recipe you need.<br><br>

                <li>Sugar:

                        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>6 to 7 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1 large egg white</li>
                <li>Optional: Turbinado or coarse sugar, ground cinnamon, vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°. On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the dough to a 1/8-in.-thick
                    circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate.<br>
                    Chill while preparing filling. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices. In a large bowl,
                    toss
                    apples with lemon juice.<br>
                    Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. Add filling; dot with butter.</li>
                <li>Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge.<br>
                    Cut slits in top. Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. If desired, sprinkle with turbinado
                    sugar and ground
                    cinnamon.</li>
                <li>Bake on the lowest rack 60-70 minutes, until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, covering
                    with foil halfway if crust<br>
                    begins to get too dark. Cool on a wire rack. If desired, serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.
                </li>
            </ol>
