    <h1>This is the main title</h1>
    <h2>this is the subtitle</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>subsection title</h3>
            <p>
                The "position" property sets the algorithm for how the Web browser will compute the way the HTML
                elements
                are placed on the page. There are four different value options for the position property:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>subsection title</h3>
            <p>
                Once you've set the position to "relative" that frees you up to set the top, right, bottom and left
                properties- otherwise known as the "box offsets". These properties specify the distance between this
                object
                and its normal static position and the corner of the box that we are specifying.

                For example, if we set the "left" to be "30px", it will move the element 30px to the right away from the
                left of where it was placed by default.
