                    A few months ago I decided to study <i>Web Development</i> and after I followed up the courses for
                    <i>Responsive Web Design</i> (both Legacy and New one) <b>@freeCodeCamp</b>, I got the

                <p>
                    Soon afterwards, in order to polish my <i>HTML</i> and <i>CSS</i> knowledge, I started learning from

                <p>In the past, besides the homework and projects received as a long time IT student I've done the

                <ul>
                    <li>took care free
                        of charge, just for fun, of the computer networks and built and installed
                        computers, setup routers and managed switches for some companies I knew</li>

                    <li>studied and implemented firewalls on Linux systems by using Netfilter and Iptables (to test and
                        learn
                        I've made a small computer network at home and installed different servers like http, ftp, dns,
                        email and
                        a
                        firewall on a dedicated Slackware machine - I kept that network functional for 2-3 years I think
                        and really enjoyed having total control over my personal servers) </li>

                    <li>helped friends build, install or take care of their own computers and, of course, I did the same
                        for myself</li>

                    <li>played with Wordpress - and I've liked it - till I seriously wanted to know more about Web
